# Singly Linked List in Java

This repository contains a simple Java implementation of a **Singly Linked List** that supports multiple fundamental operations. The code is written for educational purposes and demonstrates how linked lists work internally.

## 🚀 Features

This linked list supports the following operations:

- 🔹 Insert at the **beginning**
- 🔹 Insert at the **end**
- 🔹 Insert at a **specific position**
- 🔸 Delete from the **beginning**
- 🔸 Delete from the **end**
- 🔸 Delete from a **specific position**
- 🔍 Display the list elements

## 🧑‍💻 Code Structure

The implementation consists of:

- `Node` class — Represents each node in the list.
- `SinglyLinkedList` class — Contains all the core logic and operations.
- `Main` class — Entry point to run and test all the methods.

## 📁 Files

- `SinglyLinkedList.java` — Core file that contains all the logic for the linked list.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   cd your-repo-name

3. Compile the Java files:
   javac SinglyLinkedList.java

4. Run the program:
   java SinglyLinkedList


# Example Output :

Inserting at beginning...
Inserting at end...
Inserting at position 2...
Deleting from beginning...
Deleting from end...
Deleting from position 1...
Final Linked List: 10 -> 30 -> 50
